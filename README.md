# Spotify-Classification

Spotify released an API that reports the audio features of its songs, such as “tempo” or “energy”. Here, we will use these features of 50k randomly picked songs to predict the genre that the song belongs to.

### Data
The data is contained in the file musicData.csv. In this file, the first row represents the column headers. Each row after that represents data from one song.
